how_was_it:
- We have chosen the best of the best. The Tierser Alpl mountain refuge sits on top
  of Sieser Alm, which is the largest high-altitude Alpine meadow in Europe.
- The refuge is an historic hut used by mountaineers for decades, but has been completely
  restored and remodeled into a marvel of wooden architecture.
