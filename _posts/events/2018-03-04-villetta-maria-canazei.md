how_was_it:
- We have chosen the best of the best. The Unplug chalet is in front of the Marmolada, the highest mountain of the Dolomites. It is an occasion to really deeply connect
  with fellow entrepreneurs and investors, but most of all to feel the pull of nature,
  enjoying the silence and solitude that you can only get by being in the middle of
  the mountains.
- The chalet is an historic hut used by mountaineers for decades, but has been completely restored and remodeled into a *** hotel, with a restaurant.
