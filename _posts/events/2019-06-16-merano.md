how_was_it:
- We have chosen the best of the best. Unplug will be hosted in two amazing venues The Unplug Resort and The Unplug Refuge.

- The Resort is a ****s hotel, in Merano, often called "the pearl of the Dolomites". The Refuge instead is a mountain hut in the heart of Brenta Dolomites, grandiose mountains in the northern part of Trentino. This hut is set in the Dolomites at 2272 mt., where your view can spread above the neighboring mountains and you can't hear a sound other than animals. The location maintains the typical character of an alpine refuge, with basic-wood accommodations, intense food experience and cozy atmosphere.

- We will be sleeping in bunk bed dormitory rooms, which will give you a connection to your fellow hikers you won't get anywhere else. But then we'll hike back down to our hotel where you can relax in one of the biggests SPAs of the Alps.
